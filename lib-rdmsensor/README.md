## 10.7 Sensor Parameter Messages ##

Responding devices may contain various sensors. <br><br>
All parameter messages within this section can be used with Sub-Devices. The Root Device may contain a maximum of 255 sensors. Sub-Devices may contain a maximum of 255 sensors. However, all Sub-Devices that are owned by a specific Root Device shall respond with an identical number of sensors.<br><br>
Sensor messages may be addressed to Root Devices or Sub-Devices.<br><br>
Valid sensor numbers are in the range from 0x00 – 0xFE. The sensor number 0xFF is used to address all sensors.
