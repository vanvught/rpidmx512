## 9 Sub-Devices ##
A device may contain one or more sub-devices, all having a common set of parameters. An example of a device with sub-devices is a dimmer rack containing a number of dimmer module sub-devices.
<br><br>Sub-devices can only ever exist as part of a root device. Sub-devices may not themselves contain sub-devices.
